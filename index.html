            <p>When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually
                relegated
                to
                the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a
                high
                school student from Queens, New York, as Spider-Man's secret identity, whose"self-obsessions with
                rejection,
                inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could relate.</p>
